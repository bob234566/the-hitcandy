# HitCandy VR

This is a simple web-based game that shows a loading screen and some UI assets. To play locally, you can serve the `index.html` file with any static server.

## Running locally

If you have Python installed, run:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000> in your browser.

## GitHub Pages

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys the main branch to GitHub Pages so you can also play online when the workflow finishes.
